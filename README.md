# GoldenCross_5702final
 This is for the final project of 5702EDAV in 21 fall.

This is a part of the final project for EDAV. You can check our whole work by https://github.com/virslaan/GoldenCross . In data cleaning (data transformation) chapter, I used reticulate package in R studio, so I could write python in a .rmd file. When building the book, Python chunk has some problems with compiling. Therefore, I push all my work in this repository. 

- **03-cleaning.Rmd** is the data cleaning part. **index.html** is html file by knitting the .rmd file.
- **interactive_plot_for_processed_data.html** is the interactive plot to show our processed data, which can help us have a better understanding about what the processed data look like and how our strategy works.
- Other files are necessary for this repository, which you can ignore.

If you want to see the diagram, you can check this link to see a static picture.
